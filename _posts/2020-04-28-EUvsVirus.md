### EUvsVirus

In the past weekend I joined the [EUvsVirus](https://euvsvirus.org/) hackathon. The goal of our
team was to create a simple tool that can be used by educators to explain how a virus can spread
within a population. 

Although the resulting tool is far from being finished, you can play with the initial version 
[here](https://eusim.github.io/).
