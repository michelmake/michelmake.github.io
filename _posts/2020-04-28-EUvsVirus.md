In the past weekend I joined the [EUvsVirus](https://euvsvirus.org/) hackathon. The goal of our
team was to create a simple tool that can be used by educators to explain how a virus can spread
within a population (See the [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/political-policies-effect-on-covid-19-spread-inside-the-eu-uamhdv)).

Although the resulting tool is far from being finished, you can play with
the initial version by clicking on the GIF below:
