### Luftdaten.Info

Already long time ago I was tinkering with an air quality measuring device. It's a simple Arduino-based device as described on the [luftdaten.info](https://luftdaten.info/) project website. Today, I resurrected it from my closet and gave it life.

### Live Data

Live data can be accessed through this [Grafana dashboard](https://api-rrd.madavi.de/grafana/d/GUaL5aZMz/pm-sensors?orgId=1&var-chipID=esp8266-2634858&theme=light&from=1595835409544&to=1595857009544)

### Notes

- Sensor placed outside on 28.03.2020 (after first running it indoors for seve days) 
- Outdoor sensor location: calm street approx. three meters above local street level
