### Luftdaten.Info

Already long time ago I was tinkering with an air quality measuring device. It's a simple Arduino-based device as described on the [luftdaten.info](https://luftdaten.info/) project website. Today, I resurrected it from my closet and gave it life.

### 24-Hour Measurement Data

Below you will find the 24-hour measurements of the sensor (currently still located inside). The plots are taken directly from the [madavi.de](https://www.madavi.de) website. A future goal is to have this directly through the API with some interactive plots.

### 7-Day Measurement Data

Below you are the 7-day measurements of the sensor.
